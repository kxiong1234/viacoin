i txfered my coins off binance to my wallet and transaction code "817cdeb8e7c4f55f76a4db65c72d443cbb067417a696b3df269f7918148aeb29" you can see it on the block chain. The issue is that it was sent from Binance i can see in on my sent history from there but my viacoin wallet Desktop shows nothing. 
Not sure what the issue is, can someone assist me with it.
